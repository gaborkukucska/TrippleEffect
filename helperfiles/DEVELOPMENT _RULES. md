# Development Rules
During development please follow these rules.

*   Follow a phased implementation as outlined in the `helperfiles/PROJECT_PLAN.md` file.
*   Maintain `helperfiles/PROJECT_PLAN.md` (update status) and `helperfiles/FUNCTIONS_INDEX.md`, updating them at every milestone.
*   Write the location and name of every file in its first line like `<!-- # START OF FILE subfolder/file_name.extension -->`.
*   Follow the user's specified interaction model:
    *   Analyze context fully before suggesting changes.
    *   Provide complete file contents for modification.
    *   Wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next file.
    *   Maintain code consistency.
*   **Mermaid Syntax:** Remember that Mermaid diagrams used in Markdown (like in `README.md` or `PROJECT_PLAN.md`) are sensitive to inline comments. Use `%% Comment Text` on a **separate line** for comments within diagram definitions, not after a statement on the same line (e.g., `NodeA --> NodeB; %% This might break`).
