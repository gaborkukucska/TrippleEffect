# Development Rules
During development please follow these rules.

*   Follow a phased implementation as outlined in the `helperfiles/PROJECT_PLAN.md` file.
*   Maintain `README.md`, `helperfiles/PROJECT_PLAN.md` (update status) and `helperfiles/FUNCTIONS_INDEX.md`, updating them at every milestone.
*   Write the location and name of every file in its first line like `<!-- # START OF FILE subfolder/file_name.extension -->`.
*   Follow the user's specified interaction model:
    *   Analyze context fully before suggesting changes.
    *   Provide complete file contents for modification.
    *   Wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next file.
    *   Maintain code consistency.

# Example Mermaid graph 
**Mermaid Syntax:** Remember that Mermaid diagrams used in Markdown (like in `README.md` or `PROJECT_PLAN.md`) are sensitive to inline comments. Use `%% Comment Text` on a **separate line** for comments within diagram definitions, not after a statement on the same line (e.g., `NodeA --> NodeB; %% This might break`).

```mermaid
graph TD %% Or LR, etc. Choose layout direction

    %% --- Node Definitions ---
    %% Use simple alphanumeric IDs. Use "" for text. Use <br> for line breaks.
    %% Avoid [], (), {}, ;, or other special characters within the quoted node text unless escaped or known to work.
    Node_A["Node A Text <br>Line 2"]
    Node_B["Node B Text"]

    %% --- Subgraph Definitions ---
    subgraph Subgraph_Title ["Optional Display Title"]
        %% Indentation is optional but helps readability
        direction LR %% Optional: Direction within subgraph
        Subgraph_Node1["Node 1 in Subgraph"]
        Subgraph_Node2["Node 2 in Subgraph"]
    end %% End of subgraph

    %% --- Connections ---
    %% Use -- --> for standard links. Add labels in "".
    Node_A -- "Connects to" --> Node_B;
    Node_B -- --> Subgraph_Node1; %% Connection without label
    Subgraph_Node1 -- --> Subgraph_Node2;

    %% --- Comments ---
    %% CRITICAL: Comments MUST be on their own separate line.
    %% Do NOT place comments at the end of node or connection lines.

    %% Good Comment Style:
    %% This explains the next section.
    Node_X --> Node_Y;

    %% BAD Comment Style (DO NOT DO THIS):
    %% Node_X --> Node_Y; %% This comment will break the diagram!
```
