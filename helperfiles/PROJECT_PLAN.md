*   [X] Correct `AgentManager` check for initial task creation result.

**Phase 25: Agent Logic, Taskwarrior Refinement & Governance Layer Foundation (Completed/Advanced)**
    *   **Goal:** Address known agent logic issues, stabilize Taskwarrior integration, implement basic Governance Layer, refine thought capture, and enhance model selection.
    *   [X] Enhanced Model Selection Logic: Model selection logic refactored. New priority: Tier -> Size (larger preferred, `num_parameters` discovered for OpenRouter/Ollama) -> Performance Score -> ID.
    *   [X] Sequential Multi-Action Execution: Agents can have multiple tools execute sequentially in one "turn", with results aggregated and fed back.
    *   [X] Refined Thought Usage: Implemented smarter keyword generation (using `src/utils/text_utils.py::extract_keywords_from_text`) for thoughts saved to Knowledge Base. (Assuming `search_agent_thoughts` was part of this or an earlier completion).
    *   [X] Governance Layer Foundation: Principles loaded from `governance.yaml`. Global injection into agent prompts has been REMOVED; principles are now intended for use by the Constitutional Guardian (CG) agent.
    *   [X] `ToolInformationTool` implemented.
    *   [X] Authorization checks in `ToolExecutor` implemented.
    *   [X] System health report injected into Admin AI context.
    *   [X] Pydantic forward references for `CycleContext` and `WorkflowResult` updated for v1/v2 compatibility.

    *   [X] Refined `admin_ai_startup_prompt` for more explicit state change instructions.
    *   [X] Removed `TEAMS_CONFIG` and `allowed_sub_agent_models` handling from `ConfigManager` as they were unused.
    *   [X] Comprehensive unit tests added/updated for model selection, `num_parameters` handling, governance loading, and multi-tool call processing.

**Phase 26: Constitutional Guardian - Backend Implementation (Newly Added)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the backend infrastructure for a Constitutional Guardian (CG) agent to review agent outputs.
    *   [X] CG Agent Definition: `constitutional_guardian_ai` configured by user (via `config.yaml`), specific `cg_system_prompt` added to `prompts.json` detailing its review task and output format (`<OK/>` or `<CONCERN>details</CONCERN>`). Prompt refined to expect user message as text to review.
    *   [X] Core Logic in `AgentCycleHandler`: Implemented `_get_cg_verdict` for direct LLM call to CG (using `stream_completion`). `run_cycle` modified to intercept final agent text outputs, call CG, and if concern is raised, original agent status set to `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG`, its output is paused, and a `cg_concern` UI message is generated.
    *   [X] Agent State for CG: Added `cg_original_text`, `cg_concern_details`, `cg_original_event_data`, `cg_awaiting_user_decision` attributes to `Agent` class (`core.py`). New constants `CONSTITUTIONAL_GUARDIAN_AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_CG_REVIEW` (now unused, effectively replaced by direct call), `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG` added.
    *   [X] User Decision Handling (Backend): Implemented `AgentManager` methods (`resolve_cg_concern_approve`, `resolve_cg_concern_stop`, `resolve_cg_concern_retry`) to process user's response to a CG concern.
    *   [X] Scheduler Adjustment: `NextStepScheduler` modified to ensure agents awaiting user review (`AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG` with `cg_awaiting_user_decision = True`) are not prematurely idled.
    *   **Note:** UI and API endpoint implementation for user interaction with CG concerns are required for full functionality and are external to these backend changes.

*   **Phase 27:** Advanced Memory & Learning (Feedback Loop, Learned Principles, Advanced Thought Usage).
*   **Phase 28:** Proactive Behavior (Scheduling, Goal Management).
*   **Phase 29+:** Federated Communication (Layer 3 - External Admin AI Interaction).
*   **Phase 30+:** New Admin AI Tools, LiteLLM Provider, Advanced Collaboration, Resource Limiting, Advanced DB/Vector Store, GeUI, **Full transition to on-demand tool help** (removing static descriptions from prompts), etc.
*   Enhanced Model Selection (Tier -> Size -> Performance -> ID)
*   Sequential Multi-Action Execution for tools.
*   Constitutional Guardian (CG) Agent - Backend Foundation.

**Out of Scope (Deferred to Future Phases 27+):**

*   Global Governance Principle Injection (Removed, replaced by CG review).
*   `TEAMS_CONFIG` and `allowed_sub_agent_models` (Removed from `ConfigManager`).
*   **Phase 27: Advanced Memory & Learning.** (Feedback Loop, Learned Principles).
*   **Phase 28: Proactive Behavior.** (Scheduling, Goal Management).
*   **Phase 29+: Federated Communication (Layer 3).** (External Admin AI interaction - protocol, security, discovery).
