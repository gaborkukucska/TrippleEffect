## 4. Development Phases & Milestones

**Phase 1-23 (Completed)**
*   [X] Core Functionality, Dynamic Agent/Team Mgmt, Refactoring, Provider/Model Discovery & Selection, Failover, Key Management, Prompt Centralization, Ollama Proxy, XML Tooling, Auto-Selection (Dyn), Robust Agent ID Handling, Structured Planning, Context Optimization & FS Tools, GitHub Recursive List, ManageTeam Details, WebSearch API Fallback, SystemHelp Tool, Admin Time Context, **Memory Foundation (DB & KB Tool)**, **UI Layer Refactor & Workflow Refinements**, **Project Manager Agent & Tasklib Integration**.

**Phase 24: Admin AI State Machine & Framework-Driven Project Init (Completed)**
*   **Goal:** Refactor Admin AI workflow into distinct states and automate project/PM creation by the framework, requiring user approval.
*   [X] Add Admin AI states (`conversation`, `planning`) and `AgentWorkflowManager` for state logic.
*   [X] Create state-specific prompts (`prompts.json`) used by `AgentWorkflowManager`.
*   [X] Require `<title>` tag in Admin AI plans.
*   [X] Implement framework logic (`CycleHandler`, `AgentManager`) to intercept Admin AI plans, extract title, automatically create PM agent and initial project task (via `ToolExecutor` calling `ProjectManagementTool`), assign PM via tags/UDA, and transition Admin AI state.
*   [X] Implement UI notification for **user approval** of project start.
*   [X] Implement API endpoint (`/approve`) and logic in `AgentManager` to schedule PM agent upon approval.
*   [X] Update `SessionManager` to save/load Admin AI state.
*   [X] Fix bootstrap agent initialization fallback logic (`agent_lifecycle.py`).
*   [X] Correct `AgentManager` check for initial task creation result.

**Phase 25: Agent Logic, Taskwarrior Refinement & Governance Layer Foundation (Completed)**
    *   **Goal:** Address known agent logic issues, stabilize Taskwarrior integration, implement basic Governance Layer, refine thought capture, and enhance model selection.
    *   [X] Enhanced Model Selection Logic: Model selection logic refactored. New priority: Tier -> Size (larger preferred, `num_parameters` discovered for OpenRouter/Ollama) -> Performance Score -> ID.
    *   [X] Sequential Multi-Action Execution: Agents can have multiple tools execute sequentially in one "turn", with results aggregated and fed back.
    *   [X] Refined Thought Usage: Implemented smarter keyword generation (using `src/utils/text_utils.py::extract_keywords_from_text`) for thoughts saved to Knowledge Base. (Assuming `search_agent_thoughts` was part of this or an earlier completion).
    *   [X] Governance Layer Foundation: Principles loaded from `governance.yaml`. Global injection into agent prompts has been REMOVED; principles are now intended for use by the Constitutional Guardian (CG) agent.
    *   [X] `ToolInformationTool` implemented.
    *   [X] Authorization checks in `ToolExecutor` implemented.
    *   [X] System health report injected into Admin AI context.
    *   [X] Pydantic forward references for `CycleContext` and `WorkflowResult` updated for v1/v2 compatibility.
    *   [X] Corrected `manager.settings` AttributeErrors by using global `settings` object where appropriate.
    *   [X] Refined `admin_ai_startup_prompt` for more explicit state change instructions.
    *   [X] Removed `TEAMS_CONFIG` and `allowed_sub_agent_models` handling from `ConfigManager` as they were unused.
    *   [X] Comprehensive unit tests added/updated for model selection, `num_parameters` handling, governance loading, and multi-tool call processing.

**Phase 26: Constitutional Guardian - Backend Implementation (Completed)**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the backend infrastructure for a Constitutional Guardian (CG) agent to review agent outputs.
    *   [X] CG Agent Definition: `constitutional_guardian_ai` configured by user (via `config.yaml`), specific `cg_system_prompt` added to `prompts.json` detailing its review task and output format (`<OK/>` or `<CONCERN>details</CONCERN>`). Prompt refined to expect user message as text to review.
    *   [X] Core Logic in `AgentCycleHandler`: Implemented `_get_cg_verdict` for direct LLM call to CG (using `stream_completion`). `run_cycle` modified to intercept final agent text outputs, call CG, and if concern is raised, original agent status set to `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG`, its output is paused, and a `cg_concern` UI message is generated.
    *   [X] Agent State for CG: Added `cg_original_text`, `cg_concern_details`, `cg_original_event_data`, `cg_awaiting_user_decision` attributes to `Agent` class (`core.py`). New constants `CONSTITUTIONAL_GUARDIAN_AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_CG_REVIEW` (now unused, effectively replaced by direct call), `AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG` added.
    *   [X] User Decision Handling (Backend): Implemented `AgentManager` methods (`resolve_cg_concern_approve`, `resolve_cg_concern_stop`, `resolve_cg_concern_retry`) to process user's response to a CG concern.
    *   [X] Scheduler Adjustment: `NextStepScheduler` modified to ensure agents awaiting user review (`AGENT_STATUS_AWAITING_USER_REVIEW_CG` with `cg_awaiting_user_decision = True`) are not prematurely idled.
    *   **Note:** UI and API endpoint implementation for user interaction with CG concerns are required for full functionality and are external to these backend changes.

**Phase 26a: PM Workflow & UI Interaction Refinements (Completed)**
    *   **Goal:** Improve reliability of Project Manager (PM) agent workflows, CG concern handling, and UI message display.
    *   [X] PM Startup Workflow: Addressed issue where PM in `PM_STATE_STARTUP` outputting only a `<think>` block would not proceed correctly. Implemented specific error handling for this case to provide feedback and force retry, bypassing unnecessary CG review. (Modified `src/agents/core.py`, `src/agents/cycle_handler.py`).
    *   [X] CG Concern Targeting: Corrected logic to ensure CG concern resolutions (approve, retry) are targeted to the correct agent whose output caused the concern, instead of defaulting to `admin_ai`. (Modified `static/js/ui.js`, `static/js/handlers.js`, `src/api/websocket_manager.py`).
    *   [X] UI Chunking: Improved UI message chunk handling in `internal-comms-area` by implementing direct tracking of active streaming elements per agent, making chunk appending more robust. (Modified `static/js/ui.js`).
    *   [X] PM Prompting: Strengthened `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt` to be more directive about the initial team creation tool call. (Modified `prompts.json`).

**Phase 26b: Local API Round-Robin and Stability Fixes (Completed)**
    *   `[X] Implemented API-first round-robin selection for local providers in `_select_best_available_model` to distribute agent load across multiple discovered local API instances (e.g., Ollama, LiteLLM).`
    *   `[X] Ensured `AgentManager` tracks available local provider instances and their round-robin usage index, populated at startup.`
    *   `[X] Corrected bootstrap agent initialization (`initialize_bootstrap_agents`) to properly use the round-robin mechanism for both explicitly configured generic local providers and for auto-selected local models.`
    *   `[X] Resolved `AttributeError` in `_select_best_available_model` by correcting access to global `settings` object.`
    *   `[X] Fixed `NameError` for `error_prefix` in `_create_agent_internal` by ensuring correct variable definition order.`
    *   `[X] Corrected model ID prefix validation in `_create_agent_internal` to prevent misclassification of canonical local provider names (e.g., "ollama-local") and ensure accurate parsing of model names like "ollama/model_id".`
    *   `[X] Refined round-robin index management during bootstrap agent initialization to ensure correct sequential assignment when multiple agents use the same local provider type.`

**Future Goals:**
*   **Phase 27: Advanced Memory & Learning.** (Feedback Loop, Learned Principles, Advanced Thought Usage).
*   **Phase 28: Proactive Behavior.** (Scheduling, Goal Management).
*   **Phase 29+: Federated Communication (Layer 3).** (External Admin AI interaction - protocol, security, discovery).
*   **Phase 30+:** New Admin AI Tools, LiteLLM Provider, Advanced Collaboration, Resource Limiting, Advanced DB/Vector Store, GeUI, **Full transition to on-demand tool help** (removing static descriptions from prompts), etc.

## June 15th, 2025 - PM Agent Loop in `pm_build_team_tasks`

**Issue:**
After successfully creating the project team, the PM agent (`pm_Snake_Game_Browser_Development_startup_1749963589`) entered the `pm_build_team_tasks` state but then repeatedly finished its cycles without taking further action (i.e., not proceeding to create worker agents). This caused an infinite loop where the agent was rescheduled in the same state but made no progress. Logs indicated the agent was not producing any tool calls after the initial team creation.

**Diagnosis:**
The hypothesis was that the agent, after fulfilling the initial directive to create a team (which was also Step 1 of its workflow in `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt`), became confused by the prompt's "CRITICAL FIRST ACTION" language for team creation on subsequent turns within the same state. It wasn't robustly recognizing that Step 1 was complete and that it should move to Step 2 (Create First Worker Agent).

**Solution Attempted:**
Modified `prompts.json`, specifically the `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt`.
Step 1 of the workflow was rephrased from "Create Project Team" to "Ensure Project Team Exists."
The new instruction guides the agent to:
1. Review its message history for the current `pm_build_team_tasks` state.
2. If team creation for `team_{project_name_snake_case}` has NOT already been successfully performed in this state, then create the team as the sole action.
3. If team creation HAS already been successfully performed in this state (verified by checking for a successful tool result), then explicitly PROCEED DIRECTLY TO STEP 2: Create First Worker Agent.

This change aims to make the agent more aware of its past actions within the state and explicitly direct it to continue the workflow.

**Next Steps:**
Await user testing to confirm if the PM agent now correctly proceeds to create worker agents after team creation.

---
**Correction Update (Post-Testing Feedback):**

**Issue Identified:**
User testing after the submission (commit `pm-task-loop-fix`) revealed a `WorkflowManager` error: `Missing key: project_name_snake_case` when trying to format `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt`.
My initial diagnosis incorrectly assumed the `{project_name_snake_case}` placeholder was in Step 1 of the prompt. Subtask investigation (turn 47) found it was actually in Step 2, in the instruction for assigning the first worker agent to a team.

**Solution Implemented:**
The entire `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt` in `prompts.json` was replaced with a known-good version. This new version:
1.  Ensures Step 1 ("Ensure Project Team Exists") correctly guides the agent to check its System Context (for `Your Team ID (once created): {team_id}`) and its history, and to form the `team_id` using `team_` + the exact 'Current Project' name from its [SYSTEM CONTEXT] if creation is needed.
2.  Corrects Step 2 ("Create First Worker Agent") to guide the agent to assign the new worker to the project team ID you confirmed or created in Step 1, using the standard `{project_name}` placeholder for reference (e.g., "assign it to team `team_{project_name}`").
3.  This definitively removes the erroneous `{project_name_snake_case}` placeholder.

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting user testing of this corrected `prompts.json`.
