## Recent Development Notes & Issue Resolutions

### Agent Health Monitoring System Development (Phase 27)

**Challenge:** Agents, particularly Admin AI, were experiencing infinite loops with empty responses, almost empty responses, or identical repeated responses. The existing Constitutional Guardian system needed enhancement to catch, analyze, and restart troubled agents while preventing false positive interventions.

**Solution Implemented:** Comprehensive agent health monitoring system with multiple coordinated components:

1. **AgentHealthMonitor**: Tracks agent behavior patterns using AgentHealthRecord objects, monitors consecutive empty/minimal responses, detects repetitive patterns, and implements intelligent recovery strategies with context analysis.

2. **XMLValidator**: Handles malformed XML tool calls through automatic validation and recovery using multiple repair strategies including markdown fence removal, bracket correction, and content extraction.

3. **ContextSummarizer**: Manages conversation context through intelligent summarization for optimal performance with smaller models while preserving critical information.

4. **NextStepScheduler**: Enhanced with sophisticated agent reactivation logic that supports multi-step workflows, handles both successful and failed tool executions, and coordinates with other components to prevent infinite loops.

5. **Coordinated Loop Detection**: Multi-layered system where CycleHandler detects 3 consecutive empty responses and forces completion, while NextStepScheduler stops continuation after 2 empty cycles to prevent conflicts.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- **False Positive Prevention**: 30-second cooldown after meaningful actions prevents incorrect health interventions
- **Multi-step Workflow Support**: Agents can now execute complex workflows with proper continuation after tool calls
- **Intelligent Recovery**: Context-aware recovery strategies based on specific problem analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Context summarization and token management for improved efficiency
- **Robust Error Handling**: Enhanced XML validation with automatic repair capabilities

### PM Agent Loop Resolution History

**Issue History (June 2025):**
PM agents experienced loops in `pm_build_team_tasks` state after successful team creation, failing to proceed to worker agent creation.

**Solutions Attempted:**
1. Modified `pm_build_team_tasks_prompt` to change Step 1 from "Create Project Team" to "Ensure Project Team Exists"
2. Corrected `{project_name_snake_case}` placeholder error that was causing WorkflowManager failures
3. Enhanced Step 1 instructions to explicitly direct agents to proceed to Step 2 after team verification
4. Implemented more explicit action directives for tool listing and worker creation

**Current Status:** Resolved through enhanced prompt engineering and workflow state management improvements integrated into the Phase 27 agent health monitoring system.
