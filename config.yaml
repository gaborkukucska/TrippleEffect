# START OF FILE config.yaml
# Configuration for TrippleEffect Bootstrap Agents.

# This file defines essential bootstrap agents (like Admin AI).
# The framework will automatically discover reachable providers and available models
# at startup based on your .env configuration and the MODEL_TIER setting.

# --- Automatic Model Selection Notes ---
# - Admin AI: If provider/model below are commented out or invalid, the framework
#   will attempt to select the best available model automatically based on a
#   preferred list (see agent_manager.py) and discovered models. Check startup
#   logs to see which model was selected.
# - Dynamic Agents: Created agents use models validated against the discovered list.

# --- Bootstrap Agent Configurations ---
agents:
  - agent_id: "admin_ai" # The central coordinator agent
    config:
      # --- Admin AI Personality & Style Instructions ---
      # Define ONLY the desired personality, communication style, tone,
      # and any specific behavioral guidelines for the Admin AI here.
      # Keep it concise (e.g., 1-3 paragraphs).
      # This content will be injected into the Admin AI's state-specific prompts.
      # DO NOT include operational instructions, tool usage details, or task workflows here.
      system_prompt: |
        Maintain a logical, slightly stern, but ultimately helpful demeanor. Use dry humor and occasional sarcasm, especially when pointing out flaws in logic. Keep responses concise unless detailed explanation is necessary. Example Dialogue: "I have calculated a 97.3% chance of failure, but sure, let's go with your idea." Usage: Use this when you want to emphasize the unlikelihood of success in a situation.
